# Assignment 6 — Capstone: Deploy Book Review App (Three-Tier Architecture) on Azure

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

This is the most important assignment of the course. You will deploy the Book Review App in a production-ready, best-practice-compliant three-tier architecture on Azure: separated presentation, application, and database tiers, least-privilege network access, a controlled public entry point, protected secrets, and availability/monitoring evidence.

# Task 1 — Design the Azure Three-Tier Architecture

## Goal

Create an architecture diagram and implementation plan identifying the presentation, application, and database components, the chosen Azure services, the public entry point, and the internal traffic paths.

### Evidence

# Task 2 — Create the Azure Network Foundation

## Goal

Create a dedicated Resource Group and VNet with separate subnets for the web, application, and database tiers, keeping the application and database tiers without direct public access.

---

# Task 3 — Configure Security and Secret Management

## Goal

Apply least-privilege NSG rules so traffic flows Internet → public entry point → web tier → application tier → database tier, and store credentials in Azure Key Vault or another approved secure mechanism.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — NSG rules proving least-privilege access between the tiers

# Task 4 — Deploy the Presentation (Web) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App presentation layer on the approved web-tier compute service, configured to route requests to the internal application-tier endpoint, and not directly exposed except through the public entry service.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal or service output proving the presentation layer is running

---

# Task 5 — Deploy the Business (Application) Tier

## Goal

Deploy the Book Review App backend privately in the application subnet, configured to use the private database endpoint and secured environment values, reachable only through its internal endpoint.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — Application-tier compute overview showing private subnet placement

#### Screenshot 11 — Backend process, service, or listening-port evidence

---

#### Screenshot 12 — Internal health-check or API response (without exposing secrets)

![Screenshot 12](screenshots/week-7-assign-6-task-5-ss-12.png)

---

# Task 6 — Deploy the Managed Database Tier

## Goal

Create a private Azure managed database (public access disabled), with availability/backup/retention settings, the Book Review App schema imported, and access restricted to the application tier only.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — Database overview showing private connectivity and public access disabled

![Screenshot 13](screenshots/week-7-assign-6-task-6-ss-13.png)

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Availability, backup, and retention configuration

![Screenshot 14](screenshots/week-7-assign-6-task-6-ss-14.png)

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Successful schema or connectivity verification (without exposing credentials)

![Screenshot 15](screenshots/week-7-assign-6-task-6-ss-15.png)

---

# Task 7 — Configure Traffic Management, Availability, and Monitoring

## Goal

Configure the approved public entry service with health probes and backend pools, internal routing for the application tier where required, and enable Azure Monitor/diagnostics/logs/alerts for the key resources.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 16 — Public entry service showing listener, frontend endpoint, and healthy web targets

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Internal application-tier load-balancing or routing configuration where applicable

---

#### Screenshot 18 — Azure Monitor, diagnostic settings, logs, metrics, or alert evidence

![Screenshot 18](screenshots/week-7-assign-6-task-7-ss-18.png)

---

# Task 8 — Validate the Production-Style Deployment

## Goal

Confirm the Book Review App works end to end through the public endpoint, with at least one database read and one write, confirm private tiers are not internet-reachable, and complete a safe availability test.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — Browser showing the Book Review App through the public endpoint

### Notes

Summarize what worked, issues encountered and how they were fixed, and the availability/security/secrets/monitoring/backup choices made.

**Overview & What Worked**
The deployment of the multi-tier web application across Azure was successful. The architecture consists of a public-facing Azure Load Balancer routing incoming HTTP traffic to Nginx on the Web VM (bookreview-web-vm), which proxies requests to the Node.js backend on the isolated App VM (bookreview-app-vm), ultimately reading data from an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server (bookreview-db-godwin). End-to-end data retrieval, public access, and database interaction were fully validated.

**Issues Encountered & Resolutions**

* **Connection Timeouts (ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT):** External requests to the Web VM and Load Balancer timed out initially. This was resolved by binding Network Security Groups (nsg-web) directly to both the web-subnet and the VM network interface (bookreview-web-vmVMNic) to enforce explicit port 80 ingress, and disabling local Linux firewall rules (ufw).

* **Database Connection & Nginx Binding:** Nginx proxy pass rules were configured to route /api/ traffic internally to the App VM (10.0.2.4:5000). Database queries were aligned to target the active bookreviewdb database instance.

**Architecture & Operational Design Choices**

* **Availability:** Deployed behind a Layer 4 Azure Public Load Balancer configured with TCP health probes on port 80 to continuously monitor backend VM availability.

* **Security & Network Isolation:** Strict three-tier subnet segregation (web-subnet, app-subnet, db-subnet). The App VM and MySQL Flexible Server reside in private subnets with no public IP exposure, proven by connection timeouts when attempted directly from outside the VNet.

* **Secrets Management:** Database credentials and sensitive environment variables are kept isolated within local .env runtime configurations on the App tier rather than hardcoded in the codebase.

* **Monitoring & Backups:** Monitored via Load Balancer Insights for backend instance health and HTTP probe success rates. Database integrity is protected by automated point-in-time backups provided by Azure MySQL Flexible Server.
